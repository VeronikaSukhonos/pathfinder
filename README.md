<h1 align="center">Pathfinder</h1>

<p><b>Date:</b> October 2024.</p>
<p><b>Pathfinder</b> is a program in C that finds all the shortest paths between all the islands, using information about the bridges which connect them. The project was developed during Track C, the second stage of the <a href="https://campus.kpi.kharkov.ua/en/"><b>Innovation Campus</b></a> educational program.</p>

<p><b>The program:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>reads data from a file specified as a command-line argument;</li>
<li>finds all the shortest paths between each combination of two islands using the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm;</li>
<li>prints the paths using the FIFO rule for the islands to the stdout.</li>
</ul>

> Note that not all used functions are shown here, but only those developed specifically for Pathfinder. The program uses many functions from my library <a href="https://github.com/VeronikaSukhonos/libmx"><b>Libmx</b></a>, developed in the previous assignment.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

To compile the program, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, initialize and update `libmx` submodule and build the project using `make` command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeronikaSukhonos/pathfinder
cd pathfinder
git submodule update --init
make
```

This will first compile a static library `libmx` in its directory and then create an executable binary file `pathfinder` in the project directory.

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

<h3 id="input-file">Input file:</h3>

The first line is the number of islands, and remaining lines describe the distance between the two islands, one per line, in a format:

```
island1-island2,length_of_bridge\n
```

<p><b>Note that:</b></p>

* the names of the islands must contain only alphabetic characters, cannot be empty or identical;
* the first line and the length of the bridge must contain only digits (a positive value) and cannot be empty;
* the sum of the lengths of all bridges must not exceed `INT_MAX`

<h3>Running the program:</h3>

```bash
./pathfinder [filename]
```

<h3>Example input:</h3>

```
5
A-B,11
A-C,10
B-D,5
C-D,6
C-E,15
D-E,4
```

<h3>Example output:</h3>

```
